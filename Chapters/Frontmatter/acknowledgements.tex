I would like to thank my supervisors, Andrew Stewart and Caroline Jay. Andrew’s mentorship during my BSc and MRes degrees was foundational in motivating my PhD, and he has generously offered his time, expertise, and his fresh outlook, throughout the entire process. Caroline's perspective has also been extremely valuable and her wisdom has been instrumental in improving my work. I am very grateful to have been given the opportunity to collaborate with such a dedicated team. I am also indebted to Jen McBride for the considerate and pragmatic guidance which she offered as my advisor.  

For productive conversations, practical support, and camaraderie, thanks to Libby Le-luan, Gabe Strain, and Paul Stott. Thanks also to all in 124e, and to Tristan Johnston-Wood and Sam Langton, for sharing experiences of the PhD process. I am grateful to Boshuo Zhang and Harvey Schneider for their hard work in helping to program experimental stimuli during their Master’s programmes.
