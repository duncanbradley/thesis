# Postscript to Chapter 7

Don’t write intro/rationale until postscript to Chapter 5 is written

All of the previous work on bar charts has looked at magnitude judgements

This concludes the studies carried out. A nice way to finish, by showing the limits of the effect, and also making connections between the two previous studies. There are many more studies that would have been interesting to carry out.

Other similarities include:

Just as the bar charts study shows that default settings are not always appropriate, the choropleth maps study shows that the default plotting approach is not always appropriate. We shouldn’t rely on typical approaches, but consider whether we are really showing what is important. I do not suggest that these designs are always appropriate, but present them for consideration, to ensure that the message conveyed has been chosen wisely.
