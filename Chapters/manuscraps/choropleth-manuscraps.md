People’s Interpretations of Magnitude in Choropleth Maps Are Influenced by the Range of the Accompanying Legend

Color legends in Choropleth Maps Can Influence Interpretations of Magnitude. 
Color legends in Choropleth Maps Can Convey Magnitude, Not Just Variability

A typical use of choropleth maps is to understand the differences between regions. This is particularly the case for visual analytics, where a task is about deep understanding. However, in an information visualisation settin, the role of a visualisation is different. It does not involve assisting a user in seeing all patterns, but convey a message, to help them see what the statistics mean.

The typical color legend format is suitable for conveying magnitude relative to other plotted values, but not magnitudes in a wider context.

We can see an example of this in a chart produced by Data For Progress. They wish to convey the results of their analysis, which is less concerned with the differences between regions and more in the overall amount of support across the US. To achieve this, they use the entire range of possible values in the color legend. This helps them achieve their goal of conveying the message that the magnitude is low (as well as conveying that, in context, the variability is relatively low).

Consider a case where discernability is not important, but general context is.

interpreting spatial patterns
sometimes, when considered in a wider context, what looks like a pattern is not actually a pattern. it would be misleading to show data as varied when they are not. So you could just show an aggregate, but that wouldn’t communicate the message so strongly.

Because our investigation is concerned with conveying magnitude, not spatial variability, the concern with colour assignment is somewhat different to a typical choropleth map. The total range is an important factor, but binning, normalisation etc. is less important.

We didn’t compare typical variability-oriented designs with magnitude-oriented designs, so we can’t ascertain *how much better* the latter is at conveying magnitude. However, we do illustrate that magnitude-oriented designs do convey magnitudes.

The size of the geographic regions is likely to affect interpretations of magnitude somewhat, but in the present experiment, this impact would have probably been minimal. This is because there was relatively little variability in the size of the regions, and little variability in the numbers too. However, a follow-up which investigates this is not really necessary, because this is a feature of the *data*. Presumably, a corrective approach would re-assign colors within a certain range, but placement within the entire range would persist.

To better simplify patterns of data, . Enhance the communicative ability of the plot. One of the main functions is to see geographic patterns. 
The purpose of classifying data into discrete groups is simplification, with an express goal of illustrating the heterogeneity of dissimilar values - convey the distribution of values.
The divisions between distinct colors are known as ‘breaks’.
