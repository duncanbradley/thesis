From a cognitive processing perspective, vertical position is a strong indicator of magnitude. 

Research on data visualizations has identified cases where the relationship between magnitude and vertical position can influence interpretation. 

suggesting designers should consider this aspect when creating charts.
Axis limits and blank space warrant consideration from data visualization designers.
the presence of blank space is sufficient for implying the relative status of plotted data. 
Viewers take into account the context in which data appears, even when comparison values are not explicitly displayed.
Maximise discrimination ability
The present experiment has demonstrated that magnitude judgments are affected by the relative position of data points within the space of all plausible values. 
Emphasis on different aspects of the data may result in competition between messages.
The manipulation of visualization components examined in the present set of experiments is related to two rhetorical strategies: *axis thresholding* and *contrast.* The former is an instance of ‘information access’ rhetoric, and involves setting an axis range that provides an incomplete picture of the data. The latter is an instance of ‘mapping’ rhetoric, and employs visual properties to promote comparisons.
Both the present findings and Witt’s [@witt_graph_2019] findings suggest that processing of data in a chart is influenced by axis range. However, axis ranges designed to facilitate interpretation of the magnitude of differences may influence interpretation of the magnitudes of values, and vice versa. @witt_graph_2019 recommends setting an axis range to 1.5-2 times the plotted data’s standard deviation in order to display effect sizes appropriately. In this case, axis range is determined exclusively by the size of the numerical difference between values. The sole purpose of this recommendation is to manage bias and sensitivity when comparing two conditions (in fields with standardized effect sizes). Accordingly, providing context for *individual* magnitudes is not considered pertinent. Following Witt’s recommendations may, by chance, support processing of individual magnitudes too. For example, a large difference between two conditions would result in data points being located near the two extremes of the chart, which may also reflect genuine small and large magnitudes. At other times, however, following Witt’s recommendations could create an inaccurate impression of individual magnitudes. For example, with a small difference between two conditions would result in no data points being located near the extremes, even though they may both be genuinely large or small when considered within a larger context. Likewise, an axis range extending far beyond the plotted data (conveying values’ magnitudes), will impact discrimination abilitity, and may distract attention from meaningful variance within the data. Again, designers must consider their data and the message they intend to relate in order to balance communication of variability and individual magnitudes. A possible compromise may involve displaying values using axis limits to convey magnitude in context *and also* in a focused display to facilitate comparisons between values. This resembles an approach for communicating differences discussed by @correll_truncating_2020, and reported to benefit users by @ritchie_lie_2019. 

They used the numerical context supplied by axis limits to assess the magnitude of data points, by considering the relative standing of plotted values against the backdrop of other relevant values. 

Our results reinforce the notion that…

manipulating y-axis limits resulted in data points appearing either in the top or bottom third of a chart. 

With a conventional orientation, data points near the top represented greater values; with an inverted orientation, 

In pre-registrations for Experiment 2 and Experiment 3, we proposed testing for an interaction between our manipulation(s) and graph literacy. However, this was motivated by a concern about whether accounting for graph literacy could explain the presence or absence of effects of our manipulation(s). Therefore, we substitute these planned analyses with a more appropriate approach, treating graph literacy as a co-variate only (no interaction). This matches the pre-registered analysis from Experiment 1, providing consistency across the three experiments. Due to this revision, pre-registered hypotheses about graph literacy are not discussed.

Each trial involved a fictitious risk scenario, with data points conveying the chance of a negative outcome occurring. 

In analyses employing graph literacy as a co-variate, graph literacy scores were calculated as the average of five Likert scale responses. This means that responses to graph literacy questions were modeled as continuous data, whereas Likert scale ratings from experimental trials were modeled as ordinal data. This approach was used by the scale’s developers [@garcia-retamero_measuring_2016], but is not the most appropriate method [@liddell_analyzing_2018].

We should mention that interpretation of magnitude will not necessarily be participants’ main concern. Other cognitive processes may be occuring. Among these is the processing of the magnitude of differences, which we know is affected by axis range. Therefore, interpretation of magnitude may be affected by axis ranges which are designed to facilitate magnitude. They may focus more on the impression of the magnitude of differences, therefore the takeaway message may not be related to magnitude of values. 

Our investigation therefore only explores the cognitive bias in magnitude judgements in charts which participants know how to read.

Finally, we did not manipulate axes’ numerical ranges, so it is unclear whether a wider range of plausible values on an axis would elicit more extreme magnitude judgements.

The present study asks whether magnitude appears small because the plotted values occupy a low position, or because the plotted values are presented in the context of much larger values.

Chart designers must consider the role of their axis limits in viewers’ interpretations of the magnitudes of plotted data points. We recommend displaying the range of relevant values in order to communicate the specific context for each dataset.

The present study is concerned with the display of numerical information generally

The same data can be presented using different axes limits. These control the physical positions that data appear at. a) What are the effects of axis limits on the interpretation of magnitude? b) Are interpretations of magnitude driven by data points’ positions in physical space, or their relative positions within the axis limits? An inverted axis orientation can help answer this question
