 A single value can be associated with a variety of interpretations. Collecting magnitude judgements can extend researchers’ understanding of the effects of design choices. 
Stacked bars aid proportion judmenets (Holland and Spence, 1998). 
Investigating bias is useful because it gives insight into cognitive processing, which helps us understand people’s interpretations, and give design recommendations. 

There are two questions that could be explored with existing data, but we could be in danger of non-robust results:
 - if you discount the high responses in truncated charts, is there still a framing effect, or is it purely driven by these outliers?
 - what’s the difference between responses to textual and graphical displays of denominator? Sevilla et al. find that highlighting the denominator information reduces their bias (format neglect of percentage/top N rankings) - does that explain why we find lower ratings when denominator supplied graphically and textually?

We acknowledge that our magnitude rating measure may be unreliable becuase of low confidence.
We acknowledge that our confidence ratings measure may be unreliable becuase of poor introspection.
By combining these two analyses, we conduct a more robust analysis. It’s more precise and more comprehensive, because it indexes additional aspect of cognition. 

On the whole, participants’ responded to truncated and extended charts with broadly similar approaches. Ratings tended to correspond to the proportion of the denominator taken up by the plotted values. The absence of visual cues to numerical context in truncated charts did not totally prohibit recognition of this context. For example, when plotted values roughly equalled 20% of the denominator value, markers were placed approximately at the scale’s 20% point. In some of the truncated trials, we can see that this denominator information is used, since they approximately follow the bimodal pattern of the proportions of the data themselves. However, in other trials, it seems that the denominator information was not used, with high ratings awarded in response to the high bars. Yet, in some cases, truncated charts’ tall bars and *lack of denominator were particularly influential, eliciting extreme ratings not replicated for extended charts*. This suggests the responses were driven purely by the appearance of the values. Participants may have assumed that the upper limit was the denominator. 

For fuzzy-trace theory, the goal is to promote an appropriate gist-level message, rather than expecting memorisation of verbatim information, since gist takes precedence over verbatim information when it comes to reasoning. 

Whether denominator information is selected from charts or text seems to distinguish the two types of responses to truncated charts observed in E1. This allows us to test whether viewers’ assumptions about the denominator moderate the influence of a bar chart’s appearance. 

Although our manipulation is crude, we want to know what happens what you remove denominator information altogether. Bias is not an indicator of faulty reasoning, but provides insight into cognitive mechanisms. we want spontaneous interpretations

Such information may alter initial impressions. 
Gaining awareness of the town’s total population (the denominator) can alter initial impressions of whether this number is large or small.
