# Postscript to Chapter 5

## Overview

**The second study in this thesis was designed to examine whether colour legends influence interpretations of absolute magnitude in choropleth maps. Colour legends convey the mapping between numerical values and colours, and can be extended beyond the range of the dataset to incorporate other relevant values. This study revealed that magnitude was interpreted as greater when plotted data points were numerically high within the range of values on the colour legend. Thus, a colour legend provides a frame of reference which informs subjective judgements of magnitude.**

## Rationale for Experimental Design

Other colourmaps exist. Any colourmap would do, but choropleth maps offered more variation and realism. 

Natural frequences aren’t appropriate for choropleth maps (Dent). Had to be either percentages or frequencies, and had done percentages before.
why only pollution?
simplicity and systematic variation in the numbers required the same 

Using fictitious standardised units did not require participants to have specific background knowledge obscuring also to avoid influecing impressions of magnitude through interpretation.  

Task: as in the first study, also looks at overall magnitude (gist). Subjective judgement about fictitious standardised units, it would have been hard to just ask, how big is this? So more behavioural-based question, based on urgency. 

Why extend axis in both directions with small variation in data? Given rigid design of choropleth maps (more so than geometric graphs), it was necessary to justify why this type of design might be necessary, and to expose rigidity. Part of this was an appeal to consider designs beyond the typical use. This is important because it encourages designers to acknowledge that alternative designs are valid, and to consider whether they might want to convey a different message from the typical one. More broadly, it’s important not to be stuck with conventions. The unusualness of the design is a contribution in itself.

## Summary of Findings

### Main Summary

look at manuscraps
Wanted to see what effect the numerical labels had - were they informing judgements too? 
Striking effect is most likely due to background knowledge

### Relationship to Prior Work

Extend previous findings on axis manipulation to color legends. 
Extend previous findings on colour legends to consider axis limits.

### Relationship to Study 1

Main motivation - is the effect from Study 1 generalisable?
The primary difference is that showed that the colour legend alone could influence judgements, without changing the appearance of values
But there are other extensions too:
extending and not just translating - there doesn’t need to be a change to both limits in order to influence ratings
horiztonal axis can convey magnitude, not just vertical.
but like study 1, also shows that it’s not necessarily about whether the values *look* instrincially large or small. 

## The Next Study

### Rationale
One of the main caveats with this Study 2 was the use of standardised units. I suggest that there is a striking effect due to lack of any other context. 
There seems to be a big difference between effect sizes in E1 and E2 - how much is the chart design affecting judgements?
When thinking about context, denominators are another big issue
Bars are yet another encoding type that hasn’t been tested. 

### Pilot Study
original 2afc:
what was the study
why did it stop
what did it show
how did this inform next experiment

Concern that this wasn’t sensitive enough. When faced with two alternative designs, the design choice would be too salient, drawing attention. 

### Refinements to Pilot: The New Study

Want to look at defaults - make it more like what people might produce.
DV: ratings again.
