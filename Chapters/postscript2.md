# Postscript to Chapter 5

This study was designed to test whether colour maps show a similar bias.
The goal was to test it in something so different to really establish the generalisibility of this effect.

Given rigid design of choropleth maps (more so than geometric graphs), it was necessary to justify why this type of design might be necessary, and to expose rigidity.

Also uses a horiztonal axis, for difference to the prior experiment.

Why all pollution?

Part of this was an appeal to consider designs beyond the typical use. This is important because it encourages designers to acknowledge that alternative designs are valid, and to consider whether they might want to convey a different message from the typical one. More broadly, it’s important not to be stuck with conventions. 

## Next Experiment

There seems to be a big difference between effect sizes in E1 and E2 - how much is the chart design affecting judgements?

Want to look at defaults - make it more like what people might produce.

Bars are yet another encoding type that hasn’t been tested. Compared to the previous experiments, the manipulation of axes in bar charts potentially has the biggest noticeable different in terms of the appearance of values (i.e., a tall bar due to truncation). However, this should not be considered a confound. Rather than aiming for complete experimental control, this aims for realism. Since the bar length is intrinsically tied to the axis, it seems appropriate to investigate it as is.

Concern that this wasn’t sensitive enough. When faced with two alternative designs, the design choice would be too salient, drawing attention. Under 

Previous experiments have looked at negative outcomes, this one looks at a mix.
