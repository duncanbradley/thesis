# Postscript to Chapter 5

## Overview

The second study in this thesis was designed to examine whether colour legends influence interpretations of absolute magnitude in choropleth maps. Colour legends convey the mapping between numerical values and colours, and can be extended beyond the range of the dataset to incorporate other relevant values. This study revealed that magnitude was interpreted as greater when plotted data points were numerically high within the range of values on the colour legend. Thus, a colour legend provides a frame of reference which informs subjective judgements of magnitude.

## Rationale for Experimental Design

**Unlike the previous study, generating stimuli for this study involved identifying topics which could plausibly be associated with geographic regions. In addition, displaying absolute frequencies is not appropriate in choropleth maps (Dent, 2008), and the previous study presented relative frequencies. To manage these constraints, reduce complexity, and expand inquiry to a different type of data, all choropleth maps in this study displayed pollution measurements. Using fictitious standardised units avoided several factors interfering with magnitude judgements: participants’ prior knowledge, explanation of pollution measurements, difficulty comprehending scientific units. Use of single topic, plus reduced ecological validity, ultimately afforded greater experimental control.**

**This study explored interpretations of magnitude using rating scales, rather than measuring behaviour. However, participants were asked to rate the *urgency* with which plotted pollution levels should be addressed. This judgement assists in capturing impressions of *overall* magnitude, and avoids the abstract question of how ‘large’ values plotted are.  Furthermore, assessing urgency requires consideration of the degree of action required for addressing pollution levels, engaging participants’ decision-making capacities.**

## Summary of Findings

### Main Summary

**This work demonstrated that color legends’ limits contribute to interpretations of absolute magnitude in choropleth maps. The corresponding location of plotted data points within accompanying colour legend influenced magnitude judgements, despite consistency in the colours used to convey plotted values. Magnitude ratings were higher when data points were located closer to the colour legend’s upper limit. This suggests that the colour legend was used as a frame of reference when interpreting how high or low plotted values were. This investigation also revealed that magnitude judgements were not influenced by the numerical values of plotted data points. This is likely due to the use of fictitious standardised units, which prevented participants from drawing on contextual knowledge when assessing magnitude.** 

**Choropleth maps are usually designed in order to display spatial variability in a dataset: relative magnitude. However, this typical application does not require that these visualisations are only used for that purpose. This study illustrates that choropleth maps can also be legitimately employed to convey absolute magnitude. Thus, alternative approaches to data visualisation design which break with convention can still be valid.**

### Relationship to Prior Work

1 para:
Extend previous findings on axis manipulation to color legends. 
Extend previous findings on colour legends to consider axis limits.

### Relationship to Study 1

**The first study in this thesis demonstrated that axis limits affect interpretation of magnitude in dot plots. This second study demonstrates that these findings generalise to a different type of data visualisation: choropleth maps. These results build upon the first study’s observations by demonstrating that the numerical context accompanying data points influences interpretations even when the physical characteristics of the plotted values do not change. This also accords with the first study’s finding that judgements were primarily informed by the relative numerical positions of plotted values, as opposed to their absolute physical positions. Other contributions include demonstrating this bias occurs when manipulating only one axis limit and when using a horizontal (rather than vertical) colour legend.**

## The Next Study

### Rationale

1 para:
When thinking about context, denominators are another big issue
Numerical context for magnitude
Bars are yet another encoding type that hasn’t been tested. 

### Pilot Study
original 2afc:
what was the study
why did it stop
what did it show
how did this inform next experiment

Concern that this wasn’t sensitive enough. When faced with two alternative designs, the design choice would be too salient, drawing attention. 

### Refinements to Pilot: The New Study

DV: ratings again.

Denominators and graphical vs. textual cues.
One of the main caveats with this Study 2 was the use of standardised units. I suggest that there is a striking effect due to lack of any other context. 
There seems to be a big difference between effect sizes in E1 and E2 - how much is the chart design affecting judgements?
