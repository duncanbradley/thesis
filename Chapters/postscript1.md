## Opening: This Study Aimed…

The first study in this thesis was designed to investigate how data visualisations may influence interpretations of magnitude. Axis range was identified as a possible, becuase this accords with existing conventions around magnitude.

The notion of overall magnitude was chosen because we don’t just use visualisations to extract specific values, we use them to gain an understanding of the overall pattern (the message-level). Researchers even argue that *gist*, not verbatim information, is what informs decisions. An overall characterisation. 

## Justification for design
For this experiment, it was important to choose a visualisation type that would be amenable to axis manipulation. Dot plots were a suitable candidate for a number of reasons:
	* there was minimal change to the appearance of the values
	* inversion wouldn’t unnecessarily distort the encoding
	* no confusion due to axis starting at zero

Risk information seemed like an appropriate topic. Try to emulate the types of data that might plausibly be collected and presented in real life. 

## Findings

Like sandman, I found that the

The data are probability values. 

Therefore, our stimuli do not conform to the recommendations for visualising probabilistic information, such as explicitly encoding uncertainty and displaying discrete outcomes (Fernandes et al. 2018; Kay et al. 2016).

## Next experiment

The intention behind this thesis is to tap in to the general mechanism. I am aware that each experiment covers a small amount of ground. It’s important that sweeping statements aren’t made based on limited scenarios. I am concerned with the display of numerical information generally. Therefore, future experiments were motivated to go beyond this, to expand to another visualisation type, and non-risk data.  

what were the limitations

why did I choose to use standardised units

why visual analog scales? (maybe)

why only pollution?


Choropleth maps are a type of statistical map conveying continuous data associated with discrete geographical areas. Whereas other data visualisations encode numerical values using geometric attributes, such as length, position, or angle, choropleth maps encode values using colour. Just as with other visualisation types, the design helps convey the mapping between numerical values and visual features. However, 

For this study, the manipulation of the axes influenced the physical position of plotted data and the range of values. However, with choropleth maps.
