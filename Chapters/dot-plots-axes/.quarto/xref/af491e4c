In charts with conventional axis orientations (left column), there is congruence between data points’ physical positions and their relative numerical positions in the chart. In charts with inverted axis orientations (right column), there is incongruence between data points’ physical positions and their relative numerical positions in the chart. This allows us to test whether physical positions or relative numerical positions influence magnitude judgements."},{"order":{"number":4,"section":[3,3,1,0,0,0,0]},"key":"fig-E1-c","caption":"The distribution of Likert scale ratings of data points’ magnitudes.
