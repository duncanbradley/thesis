The y-axis limit is defined by the largest possible value, rather than the largest observed value, thus the magnitude of plotted values appears particularly small.","order":{"section":[0,3,1,0,0,0,0],"number":1},"key":"fig-senators-chart"},{"caption":"Participants rated the chance of each negative event occurring on a 7-point Likert scale. The distribution of ratings, ranging from “Very unlikely” (far left, dark green) to “Very likely” (far right, red) is shown separately for each combination of the levels of each condition (axis orientation: conventional, inverted; data points’ physical position: high, low). Note that the pattern of responses to data presented at different positions in the Conventional Axis condition appears to be the opposite to the pattern for Inverted Axis condition. When charts used conventional axes, greater magnitude ratings were more common for data presented at high physical positions, whereas when charts used inverted axes, greater magnitude ratings were more common for data presented at low physical positions.","order":{"section":[0,4,2,3,1,0,0],"number":6},"key":"fig-E2-c"},{"caption":"Rationale for Experiment 2: distinguishing the roles of absolute and relative position. In charts with conventional axis orientations (left column), there is congruence between data points’ physical positions and their relative numerical positions in the chart. In charts with inverted axis orientations (right column), there is incongruence between data points’ physical positions and their relative numerical positions in the chart. This allows us to test whether physical positions or relative numerical positions influence magnitude judgements.","order":{"section":[0,4,2,1,0,0,0],"number":5},"key":"fig-rationale"},{"caption":"Example charts, taken from Experiment 1.

The width of each response option represents the proportion of ratings recorded for that option.
