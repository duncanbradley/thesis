Mon October 09 2018

  * Calculates effective sample size more correctly, which can result in
    an effective sample size greater than the nominal sample size due to
    negative first order autocorrelation for some quantities of interest
  * Utilizes the pkgbuild R package
  * Specifying refresh = 0 suppresses all intermediate output
  * expose_stan_functions() uses a new, more robust procedure to generate
    the Stan code to be exposed to R
  * read_stan_csv() is faster with less memory consumed
  * unconstrain_pars() gains a NULL default to its pars argument, in which
    case the entire matrix of unconstrained parameters is returned
  * If the list of initial values passed to Stan has named elements, these
    names are retained in the output
  * There is now a loo.stanfit() method
  * HMC diagnostics can be obtained in a more programmatic way via
    get_divergent_iterations(), get_max_treedepth_iterations(),
    get_num_leapfrog_per_iteration(), get_num_divergent(),
    get_num_max_treedepth()

  * expose_stan_functions() handles functions that produce integer arrays
    again
  * Improved regex for class names (thanks to Torsti Schulz)
  * Passing a list of matrices to the data argument works again
2. Changes
  * When the sample_file and / or diagnostic_file arguments to sampling()
    were specified and the chains were run in parallel, the resulting file
    names were different than if the chains were run serially. The behavior
    in the parallel case has been changed to match the serial case; i.e. the
    file will be named "foo_#.csv" where # is the chain number rather than
    "foo.csv#". Some scripts that expect the old behavior may now be broken,
    but they should be fixed easily.

    it can (optionally) be utilized
