<p>When communicating with words, metaphors help convey ideas. When communicating with numbers, data visualisations perform a similar role. For example, a list of numbers can allude to an upwards trend, but representing those numbers <em>as</em> visual phenomena facilitates comprehension.</p>
<p>Whilst metaphors are evocative, data visualisations afford <em>precision</em>. Thus, in a line chart plotting an upward trend, the pattern depicted corresponds to the <em>exact</em> nature of the increase. The human visual system’s sensitivity to this systematic depiction makes data visualisation a powerful tool: presenting a different pattern would elicit a different mental representation.</p>
<p>Broadly, data visualisations make it easier for the brain to process numerical information. As <em>external</em> representations of data, they reduce perceptual and cognitive burdens in interpretation (Scaife and Rogers, 1996). Data visualisations provide efficiency and clarity, which facilitates pattern-recognition and reasoning.</p>
<p>However, a single dataset may be depicted in numerous ways, and can vary widely in their effectiveness (Franconeri et al., 2021). Thus, data visualisation’s strength can also be its vulnerability. Outsourcing cognitive processes to a graphical depiction leaves a viewer at the mercy of the chosen method of visual representation. Thus, understanding successful design is crucial.</p>
<p>The effectiveness of data visualisations can be defined in many ways, encompassing their various objectives, which include informing, persuading, engaging and promoting memorability (Bertini et al., 2020). However, in general, successful data visualisations will convey pertinent information in a visually- and cognitively-comprehensible manner (Macklinay, 1986, van Wijk, 2005). Failing to meet these criteria risks misleading viewers, which is antithetical to the purpose of data visualisation. Understanding human factors in visualisation is therefore crucial for ensuring charts, graphs, and maps achieve their potential.</p>
<p>This thesis examines one specific aspect of viewers’ interpretations of data visualisations: how large or small the numbers are. The aim of this work is to demonstrate that data visualisation design affects mental representation of numbers’ magnitudes. Through several empirical experiments, I contribute to knowledge on the cognitive mechanisms involved in forming judgements about magnitude in data visualisations. In this chapter, I review related research to provide context for the empirical work conducted in this project, before outlining the structure of the thesis itself.</p>

<p>Regrettably, our understanding of how people interpret data visualisations (and subsequent guidance) is built on shaky foundations. Some received wisdom has not been empirically tested at all, other claims have been discredited or confirmed only recently (Kosara, 2016). Consequently, it is not always clear where evidence ends and opinion starts; intuition and unsubstantiated statements make for “visualisation folklore” (Correll, 2022, pg. 3). For example, there is mixed evidence regarding the harm caused by ‘chart junk’ (i.e., visual embellishments, Franconeri et al.&nbsp;2021). However, its deprecation is superficially attractive, appealing to aesthetic judgements and ‘common sense’, so it persists (Kosara, 2016). Rigorous data visualisation research is required to fill gaps in knowledge and generate a reliable evidence-base.</p>
<p>Visualisation research takes many forms. Studies on data visualisation have employed a range of techniques, including controlled experiments, usability tests, interviews, observations, and case studies, and have focused variously on perception, cognition, exploratory data analysis, and user experience (Lam et al., 2011). Experimental psychology studies on data visualisation are particularly valuable because they generate fundamental evidence on <em>how</em> visualisations are interpreted. Conversely, research focused on visualisation design which fails to consider human interpretation does not produce the same type of generalisable knowledge. Inadequate best practice recommendations indicate insufficient understanding of psychological mechanisms. However, progress can be slow, since theories about cognitive and perceptual processes are built through cumulative work (Chen et al., 2020). Psychological research confers benefits in the form of related empirical work, alongside established methods and theories (Correll, 2022, Rensink, 2021).</p>
<p>Multiple studies illustrate that preferences and introspection are not a reliable source of information on effective visualisation practices. For example, an experiment exploring physicians’ judgements about clinical trials found that icon arrays resulted in the most accurate judgements, compared to tables, pie charts, and bar charts (Elting et al., 1999). However, none of the 34 physicians in the sample preferred this format. In another study, medical students almost unanimously preferred visualisations with a rainbow colour scheme, but made fewer errors when using a diverging (e.g., red-blue) colour scheme (Borkin et al., 2011). Tables of values may be favoured over visualisations in certain tasks where the visualisations actually offer significant benefits (Saket et al., 2019). Similarly, participants in Burns et al.’s (2021) study estimated that pictographs took longer to understand, compared to equivalent visualisations without icons. However, this self-report measure was at odds with recorded response times, which indicated no differences between visualisations types. There is also evidence that choropleth maps were preferred by graduate students despite conferring no performance advantage over other statistical map designs (Mendonça and Delazari, 2014). Many authors suggest that preferences are influenced by familiarity, rather than performance advantages. Measuring preferences provides valuable insight into people’s engagement with different visualisations. However, such opinions must be treated appropriately, not used to inform conclusions about effectiveness.</p>
<p>Rensink (2021) presents recommendations for generating useful research findings. Using a single task, and manipulating a single feature of interest, over multiple trials, assists in identifying underlying mechanisms. Integrating explanations from prior research helps ensure explanations of mental processes are sufficiently detailed. Other important but frequently overlooked matters include appropriate counterbalancing, reporting effect sizes and acknowledging individual differences.</p>
<p>There are a multitude of variables that can be manipulated to gain insight into visualisations. Criticisms are sometimes levelled at studies with particularly high or low levels of experimental control. However, researchers must strike an appropriate balance between ecological validity and precision (Abdul-Rahman et al., 2020). Choosing suitable tasks for participants requires a similar trade-off (Suh et al., 2022).</p>
<p>Vision sciences offer a variety of paradigms for assessing various aspects of human performance in visualisation tasks. For example, experiments may evaluate accuracy (by comparing responses to a correct answer), precision (by quantifying variability in responses), or processing speed (by measuring reaction times, Elliott et al., 2020). However, chosen methods must be appropriate for a research question. Whereas methods from vision-sciences are typically concerned with performance in low-level perceptual tasks, other research focuses on <em>message</em>-level interpretations (Pandey et al., 2015) or decision-making (Padilla et al., 2018).</p>

<p>Identifying gaps in our understanding of the psychology of data visualisations requires knowledge of prior lines of inquiry and established findings. Arguably the most influential study in the field of data visualisation is Cleveland and McGill’s (1984) investigation of elementary perceptual processes involved in viewing visualisations. This study sought to establish how <em>precisely</em> viewers can represent different graphical properties used to encode data (e.g., position, length, angle, etc.). For each encoding type, participants identified which of two marks conveyed the smaller value, and estimated the difference in size as a percentage. Subsequent ranking based on the magnitude of participants’ errors produced a hierarchy of visual encoding channels. Since position-encoding produced smaller errors than both length- and angle-encoding, this suggests that data will be represented most precisely when encoded using position on a common (aligned) scale.</p>
<p>This study’s findings have endured replication (Heer and Bostock) and enthusiasm for perceptual precision has inspired a great deal of important research in this field. This research spans visual processing of proportion (Spence and Lewandovsky, Hollands and Spence), variance (Stock and Behrens), correlation (Harrison et al., 2014, Hong et al., 2021), and other basic processes, such as visual comparison (Simkin and Hastie, 1987, Zacks et al.&nbsp;1998) and colour discrimination (Szafir, 2018). The study has also influenced development of software for automating visualisation design (Mackinlay, 1986) and simulating visualisation comprehension (Lohse, 1993). However, to consider perceptual precision as the <em>only</em> relevant concern in data visualisation design is unwarranted; many additional factors require consideration.</p>

<h2 data-number="2.3" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="beyond-perceptual-precision"><span class="header-section-number">2.3</span> Beyond Perceptual Precision</h2>
<p>Those viewing data visualisations do not always employ optimally-precise visual cues, which can lead to inaccurate judgements about plotted data (Yuan et al., 2021). Furthermore, in particular tasks, precision can actually hinder, rather than facilitate, judgements. For example, because perceptual averaging benefits from lower spatial frequencies, colour encoding offers greater efficiency than more precise position encoding in line charts (Correll et al.&nbsp;2012). Effective decision-making under uncertainty does not necessarily correspond to precision in probability estimation, because of the differences in mental processing associated with these two distinct tasks (Kale et al., 2020).</p>
<p>Furthermore, the choice of graphical encodings employed in a data visualisation can influence the <em>type</em> of interpretation it elicits. For example, viewers are more likely to refer to trends when describing line graphs and discrete differences when describing bar charts. This can occur even when the nature of the plotted data is ill-suited to this type of characterisation (Zacks and Tversky, 1999). This means that a line chart may provoke a peculiar interpretation such as ‘a building becomes more secure as the alarm system becomes more active’, whereas a bar chart may provoke an interpretation such as ’a building with 10 motion sensors is more secure than a building with 5 motion sensors’. Similarly, <em>production</em> of bar charts and line charts is also influenced by whether a discrete or continuous relationship is specified in the brief. Design choices also influence beliefs about the distribution of underlying data, when presenting average values. Compared to a data point positioned ‘outside’ a bar, a data point positioned ‘inside’ a bar is more likely to be considered part of the underlying data (Newman and Scholl, 2012). However, confidence intervals eliminate this bias (Pentoney and Berger, 2016). This accords with the notions that metaphor (Ziemkiewicz and Kosara) and affordances (Kindlmann and Scheidegger) play a role in a visualisation’s ability to convey information.</p>
<p>Attention is another important factor in comprehension of data visualisations. Complex tasks requiring selective attention can cause distinctive patterns in non-focal data to be completely overlooked (Boger et al., 2021). Features of data mentioned in textual summaries are over-weighted in viewers’ mental representations, causing difficulty with the ability to assume the perspective of a naïve viewer (Xiong et al.&nbsp;2019). In addition, the salience of vertical bars may be responsible for incorrect reports of differences between histograms with identical distributions (Lem et al., 2014). As a solution, explicitly encoding differences between pairs of values can facilitate pattern recognition (Nothelfer and Franconeri, 2020) and highlighting particular attributes can facilitate recall (Ajani et al., 2021).</p>
<p>Simply conveying information is not the only purpose of data visualisations, since they also influence recall, opinion-formation, and decision-making (Bertini et al., 2020). A large number of cognitive biases affect these, and several other aspects of processing data visualisations (Dimara et al., 2020). Whilst it is necessary to consider the precision of elementary perceptual processes, that alone is not sufficient for a comprehensive understanding of how data visualisations function (Bertini et al., 2020).</p>

<p>Understanding how inaccurate impressions arise provides insight into mechanisms involved in interpreting data visualisations. This, in turn, can inform recommendations for effective design. A notorious topic in the literature on misleading visualisations is axis truncation. This typically refers to the practice of employing a y-axis which commences with a non-zero value (Correll et al.&nbsp;2020), though may also be considered any adjustment at either extreme of an x- or y-axis (Pandey, 2015).</p>
<p>There is considerable evidence that the range of axis values employed in charts influences interpretations of data. The majority of research on this topic has focused on how constraining the range of an axis, and thus increasing the physical distance between plotted values, increases the perceived magnitude of the difference between those values. For example, accountants appraising financial performance using line and bar charts interpreted plotted increases as larger when they were depicted using a truncated y-axis (Taylor and Anderson, 1986). Similarly, bar charts employing truncated axes biased students’ investment decisions (Arunachalam and Pei, 2002). A large-sample online experiment also observed that differences between values were considered larger when truncated bar charts were used (Pandey et al., 2015). This experiment examined message-level representations of data by framing questions in terms of subject matter (e.g., access to safe drinking water) rather than graphical elements (e.g., difference in bar length. Other axis manipulations, such as log-scales (Romano et al., 2020), inverted scales (Woodin et al., 2021, Pandey et al., 2015), and expanded axes in scatterplots (Cleveland, 1982) also influence judgements about data.</p>
<p>Risk communication research has independently generated similar findings. Because many hazards cannot be completely avoided, data visualisations are often used to contrast the levels of risk associated with two scenarios (e.g., intervention versus no intervention). Thus, assessments of ‘risk reduction’ are essentially judgements about the magnitude of difference between two values. For example, one experiment compared stacked bar charts, which include additional information on the total number of individuals at risk, to bar charts which displayed only the number of individuals <em>affected</em> (Stone et al., 2003). The latter design increased the bars’ visual disparity, and subsequently increased impressions of the magnitude of difference.</p>
<p>The physical distance between data points consistently biases interpretations of the magnitude of difference in spite of attention to actual numerical values and also design features intended to highlight truncation (Correll et al., 2020). Bias is diminished, but still observed, following explicit warnings about errors in judgement due to y-axis truncation. This suggests that this effect is largely automatic, and does not primarily occur due to insufficient engagement of cognitive capabilities (Yang et al., 2021).*</p>
<p>One study observed no association between participants’ data visualisation literacy and their susceptibility to bias due to axis truncation in bar charts (Yang et al., 2021). Conversely, another experiment suggests that the effect of axis truncation on subjective judgements and quantitative estimates in line charts disappears when accounting for data visualisation literacy (Driessen et al., 2022). However, low variability in observed data visualisation literacy levels in the latter experiment raised concerns about the scale used to measure data visualisation literacy.</p>
<p>Pandey et al.&nbsp;(2015) and Yang et al (2021) propose that this bias could arise due to the dominance of first impressions during translation from graphical schemata (Pinker, 1990) to a ‘real-world’ conceptual understanding (see also, Carpenter and Shah, 1998, Tversky and Kahneman, 1974). Additionally, Yang et al.&nbsp;(2021) suggest that viewers’ beliefs about the communicative intent of a designer could play a role in viewers’ interpretations. Under Grice’s <em>Co-operative Principle</em> (Grice, 1975), communicative contributions in conversation are assumed to be truthful, relevant, clear, and sufficiently informative. To extrapolate this to data visualisations, viewers might infer that differences between values must be genuinely large if they appear large, because they would otherwise not be presented as such.</p>
<p>In <em>How to Lie With Statistics</em>, Huff (1954) suggests that axis truncation creates a false impression of plotted data. This practice has been labelled ‘deceptive’ for both bar and line charts (Lauer and O’Brien, 2020). A tool for automatically identifying and correcting misleading line charts extends y-axes to include zero whenever this value is omitted from the original chart (Fan et al., 2022).</p>
<p>Recent work has presented an alternative perspective on this controversial practice. Non-truncated axes can obscure significant differences just as easily as truncated axes can exaggerate inconsequential differences. The appropriate magnitude to convey depends on what constitutes an important difference in the data at hand (Correll et al., 2020). Indeed, <em>failing</em> to truncate an axis could be considered misleading in certain circumstances (Wainer, 1984). Yang et al.&nbsp;(2021) suggest that effective designs will ensure that a viewer’s immediate characterisation of plotted data closely corresponds to their interpretation following a detailed inspection. Acknowledging that differences must be depicted in proportion to their significance, Witt (2019) reports that axes spanning approximately 1.5 standard deviations provide a balance between sensitivity and bias in fields with standardised effect size measures, such as psychology. Unfortunately, different domains will not necessarily share the same notion of what amounts to a meaningful difference. Choices regarding axis ranges are ultimately designers’ unavoidable decisions (Correll et al., 2020).</p>
<p>Although line charts and bar charts are equally susceptible to biases due to truncation (Correll et al., 2020; Witt et al., 2019), there may be reason to treat them differently. Truncation distorts the mapping between a bar’s extent and the quantity it represents, but free-floating position-encoding used in line charts does not convey quantity in the same manner, providing immunity against such distortion (Bergstrom and West). Therefore, whilst starting an axis at zero cannot guarantee that differences between values are depicted appropriately, this does ensure adherence to a fundamental aspect of visualisation design. Alternatively, to avoid this trade-off, quantitative data with discrete categories can be plotted using position-encodings only (e.g., dot plots).</p>

<p>Some misleading visualisations may prevent viewers from accurately extracting numerical information. However, research on axis truncation illustrates that misleading visualisations may also interfere with subjective judgements. A line chart may avoid misrepresenting a dataset’s numerical properties yet generate a distorted impression of the magnitude of a trend. The latter is revealed not by assessing the <em>performance</em> of viewers, but their <em>interpretations</em> (Stone et al., 2015).</p>
<p>Influencing subjective judgements may still be considered a <em>misleading</em> practice because a dishonest framing of information could elicit an unreliable interpretation that would differ from the same viewer’s better-informed perspective. Not all aspects of deceptive design are <em>inherently</em> misleading, and deceptiveness can be context-dependent. Comparing examples of ‘misleaders’ from Ge et al.’s (2023) design space helps illustrate this distinction. ‘Concealed uncertainty’ and ‘cherry-picking’ refer to unambiguously deceptive practices, whereas ‘aggregation’ and ‘scale range’ must be preceded by the word <em>inappropriate</em> in order to convey their capacity to deceive.</p>

<p>Understanding individual differences in the ability to comprehend data in visualisations is important for understanding the psychology of data visualisations (Boy et al., 2014). Research on this topic requires reliable tools for measuring data visualisation literacy.</p>
<p>Galesic and Garcia-Retamero’s 13-item test (2011) was based on Friel et al.’s (2001) hierarchy of skills for interpreting visualisations, which ranges from comprehension to extrapolation. Research has demonstrated that this scale can predict whether a graphical representation will facilitate understanding of risk information (Okan et al., 2012). A different 53-item test employs a wide range of data visualisation formats, and higher scores are positively associated with both numeracy and need for cognition (Lee et al., 2019).</p>
<p>Research on data visualisation literacy has tended to focus on interpretation of well-designed charts (Ge et al., 2023). However, the ability to detect (Camba et al., 2022) and make sense of (Ge et al., 2023) misleading charts should be considered an important feature of data visualisation literacy. A robust 30-item test enables assessment of an individual’s ability to accurately comprehend deceptive designs (Ge et al., 2023). This work also suggests that attention and critical thinking may benefit viewers in avoiding some, but not all, biased interpretations. Using Galesic and Garcia-Retamero’s 13-item test (2011), Okan et al.&nbsp;(2016) found that higher data visualisation literacy is associated with more time processing a visualisation’s misleading features, thus promoting correct interpretations. Lower data visualisation literacy is associated with greater reliance on conventions (e.g., the relationship between vertical position and magnitude).</p>
<p>The empirical work presented in this thesis employs the 5-item version of Garcia-Retamero et al.’s (2016) Subjective Graph Literacy scale. Users are asked to rate their competence in working with bar charts, line charts, and pie charts, and also their ability to perform simple tasks using bar charts. This approach echoes prior work in the development of subjective numeracy scales. Despite its short completion time and use of subjective ratings, it is strongly correlated with an objective measure of data visualisation literacy (Galesic and Garcia-Retamero, 2011). The scale also produces a final score out of 30, offering greater sensitivity than a similarly brief objective scale, where tallying correct responses produces a final score out of 4. These characteristics make for an appropriate tool for assessing participants’ data visualisation literacy in experimental studies. Indeed, this measure has been used to assess variability between participants in studies on axis truncation (Yang et al., 2021), correlation (Strain et al., 2023), information synthesis (Mantri et al., 2022), and explanation of visualisations (Yang et al., 2023).</p>

<p>Data visualisation design has the potential to impact subjective judgements of many aspects of data, such as variability, noise, and numerosity. Prior research has closely examined how axis truncation can influence judgements of <em>relative</em> magnitude (differences between values). In contrast, little is known about how axis limits may influence judgements of <em>absolute</em> magnitude: how large or small values are. Limited insight into how magnitude is interpreted in data visualisations impedes understanding of how visualisations may effectively communicate magnitude. Prior research on this topic is summarised below.</p>
<p>In bar charts displaying data on individuals affected by a risk, perceived likelihood decreased when the total population at risk was emphasised using shaded bars, rather than blank space (Stone et al., 2017). In bar charts violating the convention of mapping higher values to higher positions, participants frequently misinterpreted magnitudes (Okan et al., 2012). This was due to difficulty in rejecting first impressions, particularly for participants with low data visualisation literacy. Other work combining judgements of values’ magnitudes with judgements of relative differences has limited examination of the former (Okan et al., 2018). Visualisations that facilitate comprehension of relative differences may fail to effectively communicate the absolute magnitudes of values depicted, illustrating a potential trade-off in design (Reyna et al., 2008).</p>
<p>One study has specifically focused on how axis ranges may inform impressions of absolute magnitude. Sandman et al.&nbsp;(1994) manipulated risk ladders, where individual probabilities are presented on vertical scales incorporating a range of probability values. Changing this range alters the position of a plotted value. Perceived threat (a composite measure made up of perceived likelihood, danger, reported concern and fear) was higher when the risk appeared near to the top of the ladder, compared to near the bottom. However, the position of plotted values did not completely dictate magnitude judgments. A numerically higher risk plotted at the same position near the top of the ladder generated higher ratings. There was also mixed evidence regarding the effects on intentions to spend money mitigating the risk. Confidence in the robustness of these findings is limited by various factors including use of a single trial per participant, a single scenario, a composite measure obscuring pure magnitude ratings, and a confounding variable of the risk ladder’s range.</p>
<p>Comparing linear and logarithmic risk ladders, Freeman et al.&nbsp;(2021) did not replicate Sandman et al.’s (1994) main finding. However, in addition to a graphical cue to magnitude, they used risk ladders which employed additional symbolic number cues in their titles, labels, and accompanying descriptions. A broken scale may also have reduced the degree to which inferences were based on the value’s physical position. Therefore, participants’ judgements may not have been based purely on the appearance of visualisations.</p>
<p>This thesis presents a detailed investigation into how impressions of the magnitude of numerical values are influenced by data visualisation design.</p>

<h2 data-number="2.8" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="overview-of-thesis"><span class="header-section-number">2.8</span> Overview of Thesis</h2>
<p>The objective of this thesis is to demonstrate that design choices influence cognitive processing of the magnitude of values presented in data visualisations. I present several empirical studies, each investigating different factors affecting viewers’ interpretations and each using a different data visualisation format.</p>
<p>Chapter 2 discusses how reproducibility issues threaten the validity and trustworthiness of research projects. A lack of transparency decreases the utility of published work for both authors and their peers. Approaches for remedying these issues are presented, in line with recommendations from a variety of disciplines. A particular emphasis is placed on computational reproducibility: the capacity to replicate the computational environment used in generating results. This provides background for the practices used in each of the following empirical research chapters.</p>
<p>Chapter 3 presents a pair of experiments which establish that interpretations of magnitude can be influenced by data visualisation designs. The first experiment demonstrated that manipulating axis limits in dot plots affected participants’ judgements of overall magnitude. A second experiment investigated whether this occurred because axis limits altered the absolute or relative positions of plotted values within axis limits. In dot plots with inverted y-axes, where higher numerical values are presented at lower positions, values near bottom were associated with higher magnitudes. This illustrates that interpretations of magnitude are informed by the relative positions of values within axis limits.</p>
<p>Chapter 4 presents an experiment which explores how visualisations may influence interpretations of magnitude even when the appearance of plotted values remains unchanged. This experiment demonstrated that manipulating color legend limits in choropleth maps affected participants’ judgements of overall magnitude. Participants rated magnitudes as lower when the range of values on the color legend extended beyond the largest plotted value. This illustrates that the numerical context accompanying plotted values can influence interpretations of magnitude, without altering the physical appearance of those values.</p>
<p>Chapter 5 presents a pair of experiments which investigate the role of contextual information on interpretations of magnitude. The first experiment demonstrated that participants’ judgements of overall magnitude were affected by extension of bar charts’ upper axis limits which incorporated a denominator value. A second experiment revealed that participants’ bias was increased when this denominator information was excluded from the text accompanying the chart. This illustrates that knowledge about a dataset’s characteristics (e.g., denominator value) can influence the extent to which design choices affect interpretations of magnitude.</p>
<p>Finally, Chapter 6 presents a synthesis of this empirical work, alongside a discussion of implications and future directions.</p>
