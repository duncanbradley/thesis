# The State of Visualisation and Psychology Research

Kosara (2016) makes the case for a solid empirical foundation for design guidelines. However, the evidence base is weak (Kosara, 2016). Some of the recieved wisdom has not been tested at all, other guidance has been disproven or has been confirmed only recently. It’s not even always clear where the evidence ends and the opinion starts - intuition and unfounded statements make for “visualisation folklore” (Correll, 2022, pg. 3). The role of data visualisation research is to generate robust evidence to fill gaps in knowledge. As Correll’s article explores reserarchers’ shared values (). This work was not a systematic review of all literature, but points towards a lack of consistency in achieving new knowledge. 

The stuff that has been really successful isn't really new. It's established psychology effects applied to visualisation (attention for focus and declutter, curse of knowledge, datasaurus (Boger)). What does this say about where we need to look for new knoweldge?

Adjacent fields like perceptual psychology might tackle problems well because of more established methods, related empirical work and theory (Correll, 2022). The best source of theory in visualisation might be pyshcological perception and cognition research (Rensink, 2021).

There’s a distinction between my point about asking designers what they think works and asking viewers what they think works. The first is a point about whether claims are built on any evidence at all. The second is a point about whether claims are built upon *the right type* of evidence. 

Why can’t we just ask people?

Different approaches to studying - correctness vs interpretation

MacDonald-Ross (1977; see Spence and Levandovsky, 1991) also cautions against making dismissive judgements about ‘expert’ advice in the absence of empirical evidence. Pie charts were used widely without expert approval, but Spence and Lewandowsky find evidence that they are useful in certain scenarios.  - relate this to Tufte
  
The picture is complicated further by examples that don’t even conform to empirical findings
This is echoed by Bertini et al. (2020), who mention Heer et al.’s (2010) work which explores the notion that effective visualisations may not conform to the simple rules generated by empirical findings.

Desbarats - is it all just ‘it depends’?
So we have to acknowledge that it’s not as simple as following a set of rules - context and rhetoric also play a role

# Precision

Arguably the most influential experiment in the data visualisation field was conducted by Cleveland and McGill (1984), who sought to identify elementary perceptual processes involved in viewing visualisations. There are many different ways of graphically representing values. However, the precision of the visual system’s differs according to the characteristics of the stimulus. Therefore, through psychophyiscal testing, it’s possible to work out how well interpretations of different presentation formats correspond to the actual numbers. For each visualisation, participants identified which of two marks conveyed the smaller value, and estimated, as a percentage, how much smaller this was than the larger mark. The consequent leaderboard is the “ranking of visual channels”.  Position-encoding produced less error than both length- and angle-encoding. Therefore, where possible, data should be encoded using position on a common (aligned) scale. This means that grouped bars elicit more precise representations than stacked bars. How do we interpret this ranking? Are there theoretical reasons for why area is not as good as other channels?

The issue here is not the work itself, rather the interpretation of this work. Indeed, this work has endured replication (Heer and Bostock), it’s findings are far-reaching and really useful. However, to naively take this as the *only* relevant consideration is unheeded, as there are many other tasks than judging ratios. (Bertini et al. 2020). 

Position-encoding is the optimal choice for extracting single values, but is not necessarily the optimal choice for other tasks (e.g., pattern recognition). The ability to extract values is not the only use of charts. Different tasks benefits from different encondings. One particularly interesting example is situations where precision hinders, rather than facilitates, judgements (Correll et al. 2012). Aggregretation tasks are less concerned with specifics, more concerned with overview, so there are better encoding types, which are less precise. Line charts typically used for timeseries data. The way the visual system tackles line graphs makes it more difficult to perform averaging. Averaging is particularly efficient at lower spatial frequencies, so there is better averaging with color than line graphs. This finding offers a new perspective on Anscombe’s quartet. Effectively conveying differences between datasets conceals their similarities. Using a less precise visual channel would facilitate recognition of the latter. 

Furthermore, different encoding types are suited to different types of data. For example, some are intrinsically suited to displaying part-to-whole relationships (e.g., pie charts, stacked bar charts), whilst others are better suited to displaying trends (e.g., line charts). Zacks and Tversky (different chart types serve different purposes); 

The choice of certain graphical encodings can influence interpretations of the type of data a visualisation presents. Zacks and Tversky (1999) found that participants were more likely to refer to discrete differences when describing bar charts, and trends when describing line graphs. Responses were more influenced by graph format than by data type. Zacks and Tversky explained how this can lead to an atypical description, with discrete gender differences characterised using gradated changes (e.g., *“The more male a person is…” *). However this particular (now well-known) comment was only given by 12% of participants. *Production* of bar charts and line graphs was also influenced by whether a discrete or continuous relationship was specified in the description. Zacks and Tversky argued that cultural conventions in visualisation design are likely to play a substantial role in the driving these effects, with perceptual and cognitive biases playing a more minor role. Metaphor/affordance/congruence.
Displaying proportions with encoding that factilitate recognition of part-to-whole relationships (e.g., Spence and Levandovsky, 1991) can be achieved using stacked bars and pie charts, but not with grouped bars, which would be favoured by the precision rankings. 

Finally, Bertini et al. explained that simply conveying information is not the only purpose of data visualisations. They can also be persuasive, help individuals to remember information, or aid decision-making. It is important not to narrowly define effectiveness as extraction efficiency, but to consider effectiveness within the wider context of the multiple functions that visualisations can serve. Hullman et al, (2011) - inefficent processing due to “visual difficulties” may benefit cognition. 

The precision work speaks to our concern with (in)accuracy - that we might be misleading others, that others may mislead us, that charts may be weak and lack clarity. But there is so much more than simply extracting values wrong.

# General Framing in Data Vis - Cognitive Bias

Previously discussed work has been concerned with whether values are extracted precisely. But thisn’t isn’t the only way values can miselad. What other ways could we be mislead, not by imprecision (perceptual bias), but by cognitive bias.

How do I move from general cognitive bias to truncation specifically?
What’s different about truncation?

# Truncation

One topic that has enjoyed attention in recent years is axis truncation. This issue has also captured minds outside of academia. Perhaps it’s particularly interesting to engage with (for both groups) because it seems like a big change comes from a subtle manipulation. The data and the chart type both stay the same; all that’s needed is a tweak of the axis. It is another example of where popular opinion can be at odds with research findings. Part of this may be because people like simple rules, but the research doesn’t offer simple rules here.

To what extent is there a difference in the definitions of ‘axis truncation’:
  * both ends vs. one end
  * bars vs. axes
What is it about Witt’s study that means it can give such precise recommendations whereas others can’t

There is an important distinction between ‘error’ and ‘bias’ - various interpretations may not necessarily be wrong - just different.

Introducing my topic - magnitude judgements:
Rarely mentioned as deceptive when describing axis manipulations

Certain types of misleading design are consistently misleading (e.g. inverted y-axis). They are consistently misleading becuase this isn’t based on the data at all. Other types are not consistently misleading (e.g. truncated y-axis). Here, it’s impossible to say *a priori* that a chart is misleading because the quality of the design depends on the data. Therefore, it’s really about the *potential* to mislead. A simple test could be whether the ‘misleader’ (to use Ge et al.’s (2023) term) needs to have the word ‘inappropriate’ before it to convey the issue. For example, concealed uncertainty, cherry picking, missing data are all self explanatory, but ‘aggregation’ and ‘scale range’ need the word inappropriate before them in order to highlight the issue. It is the later that might be considered ‘potentially’ misleading. Ge et al. (2023) also note that assessing response accuracy requires a specific task, so misleadingness will always be related to specific tasks. 
  
# Visualisation Literacy

Increasing popularity and use of data visualisation has expanded the audience who are exposed to charts. Burns et al. (2023) discusses research aimed at understanding how relatively inexperienced users understand charts. This is important, but there is inconsistency around what constitutes a novice, and also a inconsistency between general population and samples used to explore that population. The term novice is unhelpful since it forces a binary perspective onto a more nuanced picture. Why not look at individual variation in ability? Burns reports very few cases where novice was defined by literacy.

It is useful to understand variability in biases by looking at individual differences. Get a better picture of how they might work, and the types of audience most likely to be affected. 

Some people are ‘novices’ - discuss the two novices papers - but there are not just two groups - literacy scales can be useful
Visualisation literacy is the ability to comprehend data presented in visualisations (Boy et al.)

Galesic and Garcia-Retamero’s 13-item scale (2011) was based on Friel et al.’s (2001) hierarchy of skills for interpreting visualisations.

Boy et al (2014) developed a new method
Garcia-Retamero et al. (2016) developed a new method due to the length and potential negative consequences of previous tests (i.e. inducing anxiety). Based on prior work developing numeracy scales through subjective judgements. The 5-item version is a refined version of the 10-item subjective scale, based on the items which most strongly correlated with the objective measure, and actually performs better than the 10-item scale. Final items focused on skills (how good are you at …)  more than preferences ( do you like ….) . Diverse participant pool (US m-turkers, UGs in Spain, surgeons and patients in Spanish hospitals). Captures variation in both objective abilities but also metacognition - beliefs about own abilities/skills.

Lee et al. (2017) - justification for creating the VLAT
Camba et al. (2022) suggest that the ability to detect misleading charts should be considered an important feature of data visualisation literacy. 
Ge et al. (2023) noted that previous work on visualisation literacy has focused on interpretation of well-designed charts. Despite this, the ability to make sense of poorly designed charts is also relevant. Good approach - not to ask Ps whether they think the charts are misleading, but to intersperse misleading and honest charts within a test and measure accuracy. Develop a robust test of 30 items to assess ability to accurately comprehend deceptive designs. Ge et al. (2023) suggest that sufficient attention and critical thinking can help combat misleading visualisations. However, some cognitive biases are persistent even against these efforts. Perhaps this is where the distiction between correctness and interpretation comes in (see Correll et al., 2020, Yang et al., 2021 Stone et al., 2015).

# Numerical Framing

General knowledge on cognition about numbers - couple of papers summarising how good/bad we are and interesting findings. 
Non-visual perspective
What is framing generally? What does it show about how our brains represent information?
Lundquist et al. 
Link to Grice - readers/viewers make assumptions about communicative intent. They aren’t just passive receipients. 
Therefore there is a trust element - when trust is high, more likely to fail to question the delivery of the message. 
Which papers cite Brown (2008) and Borges (1974)?

Other numerical biases have been studied in a datavis context e.g. Dimara et al. 2017, 2019

Framing effects were initially primarily a reference to valence framing, but have since expanded to encompass a wider range of biases.
