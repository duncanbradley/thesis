A data visualisation’s y-axis may be expanded to incorporate not just plausible values, but a *denominator* from the underlying dataset. When this graphical cue is accompanied by a textual cue to denominator information, its influence on interpretations of magnitude is diminished, compared to when no textual cue is present. Thus, this study revealed that accompanying contextual information, not just visualisation design, informs subjective judgements of magnitude.\n\n## Rationale for Experimental Design\n\nThis study aimed to explore how axes which incorporate denominator values affect magnitude judgements. Manipulating upper axis limits in bar charts necessarily alters the length of the bars. Therefore, the differences between conditions in this study are less subtle than in the first study in this thesis, which employed dot plots. However, changes in the length of bars themselves should not necessarily be considered a confound. It is impossible to avoid these changes, therefore the resulting *overall* appearance of the visualisation should be considered part of the manipulation. A lack of precise experimental control over separate elements does not preclude valuable insight into the cognitive processing of magnitude in bar charts.\n\nThis study employed default axis limits from a popular visualisation tool in half of experimental trials. As default settings are frequently adopted by data visualisation designers, this reduces artificiality in stimuli, enhancing the experiment’s ecological validity. In addition, adopting default settings means this study’s conclusions are directly applicable to common visualisation designs, assisting the development of relevant considerations for designers.\n\n## Summary of Findings\n\nIn the first experiment in this study, participants rated magnitudes as lower when axes terminated well above plotted data, compared to just above plotted data. The former condition provided a graphical cue to the relevant denominator value, whereas the latter condition, which used the default axis setting, did not. When there was no graphical cue to the denominator, a proportion of extreme high magnitude ratings reflected substantial differences in the interpretation of charts in the two conditions. The second experiment revealed that substantial differences in interpretation regularly occur when accompanying text omits denominator information, eliciting a greater bias than when denominator information is included. This interaction demonstrates that awareness of the numerical context of plotted values diminishes the influence of axis limits on interpretations of magnitude.\n\nRisk perception research on axes and denominators in bar charts has observed that including labels with numerical values decreased the impact of graphical depictions (Okan et al., 2018). The final study in this thesis corroborates this claim by manipulating numerical values in accompanying text. Prior work has measured risk understanding (Garcia-Retamero and Galesic, 2010), or combined absolute magnitude ratings with other judgements to create a general risk perception measure (Okan et al., 2018). These studies have not examinated absolute magnitude judgements in isolation. Therefore, the final study in this thesis expands upon this work by examining absolute magnitude judgements. This study also explores responses to a different topic, which does not concern risk. \n\n## Relationship to the Studies in Chapter 3 and Chapter 5\n\nThis study concludes the empirical investigations in this thesis by revealing how axis limits and additional cues interact to influence magnitude judgements. This demonstrates that considering contextual information is important for understanding the effects of design choices on interpretations of magnitude. However, it also provides insight into the differences in the two preceding studies regarding the *extent* to which axis limits influenced magnitude judgements. The first study observed relatively small differences in participants’ ratings between conditions, whereas the second study observed much larger differences. In light of this final study’s findings, it seems likely that differences in contextual information may have contributed to these contrasting results. In the second study, use of fictitious standardised units may have increased reliance on axis limits as a source of information when assessing magnitude. Consequently, this resulted in increased bias in judgements.\n\nThis study used denominator values as upper axis limits. This contrasts with preceding studies, where the data (i.e., relative frequencies, measurements) do not have corresponding denominators. Therefore, the final study extends the line of enquiry to examine a different approach to setting axis limits, based on the underlying dataset. By incorporating a denominator, an axis presents the entire range of possible values, rather than a range of plausible values. Viewers’ inferences about magnitude may differ in these two cases. Denominators may increase awareness of whether plotted values are *numerically* high or low, whereas plausible values may increase awareness of whether plotted values are *comparatively* high or low, in the context of other relevant magnitudes. Alternatively, viewers may not be sensitive to this difference. This would be an interesting topic for future work, providing greater insight into the framing effects elicited by axis limits.\n\nBoth this study on bar charts and the second study on choropleth maps explore approaches to designing data visualisations beyond typical defaults. They suggest that not all data visualisation designs are suitable for communicating all aspects of data. Therefore, considering alternatives to the default options may be useful when conveying absolute magnitude. Atypical approaches to data visualisation design may provide clarity for viewers.\n"},"formats":{"html":{"execute":{"fig-width":7,"fig-height":5,"fig-format":"retina","fig-dpi":96,"df-print":"default","error":false,"eval":true,"cache":null,"freeze":false,"echo":true,"output":true,"warning":true,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":null,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"engine":"markdown"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"html","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":"none","code-overflow":"scroll","code-link":false,"code-line-numbers":false,"code-tools":false,"tbl-colwidths":"auto","merge-includes":true,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-input-paths":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":false,"link-external-newwindow":false,"self-contained-math":false,"format-resources":[]},"pandoc":{"standalone":true,"wrap":"none","default-image-extension":"png","to":"html","filters":["section-bibliographies"],"citeproc":true,"toc":true,"toc-depth":3,"output-file":"postscript3.html"},"language":{},"metadata":{"lang":"en","fig-responsive":true,"quarto-version":"1.2.335","thesis":{"degree-name":"Doctor
