# Introduction

**When communicating with words, using metaphors helps conveys ideas. When communicating with numbers, data visualisations perform a similar role. A list of numbers can allude to an upwards trend, but representing those numbers *as* visual phenomena facilitates comprehension.**

**Whilst metaphors are evocative, data visualisations afford precision. In a line chart plotting an upward trend, the pattern depicted corresponds to the exact nature of the increase. The human visual system’s sensitivity to this type of systematic depiction makes data visualisation a powerful tool. Presenting a different pattern would elicit a different mental representation.**

**Broadly, data visualisations make it easier for the brain to process numerical information. As *external* representations, they reduce perceptual and cognitive burdens in interpretation (Scaife and Rogers, 1996). Imparting efficiency and clarity facilitates pattern-recognition and reasoning.**

**However, a single dataset can be depicted in countless different ways, and results can vary widely (Franconeri et al., 2021). Thus, data visualisation’s strength can also be its vulnerability. Outsourcing cognitive processes to a graphical depiction leaves a viewer at the mercy of the chosen method of visual representation. Thus, understanding successful design is crucial.**

**Success can be defined in various ways, encompassing visualisations’ various objectives, which include informing, persuading, engaging and promoting memorability (Bertini et al., 2020). However, in general, successful data visualisations will convey pertinent information in a visually- and cognitively-comprehensible manner (Macklinay, 1986, van Wijk, 2005). Failing to meet these criteria risks misleading viewers, which is antithetical to the purpose of data visualisation.** 

Much visualisation research has been concerned with breaking down the relationship between viewers and visualisations. Through these efforts, we can identify relevant aspects of human interaction that are worth considering in design.

# Thesis Statement

It is my thesis that interpretations of magnitude can differ according to the design of a data visualisation. Judgements pertaining to values’ magnitudes are under-explored in data visualisation research, but are relevant to interpretations and decision-making. The effect is one of context: certain aspects of a chart subtly convey the context surrounding values, giving cues to magnitude. However, it must be recognised that there are limits to a chart’s influence, and that magnitudes judgements are not wholly determined by the presentation style.

It is my thesis that the design of a visualisation can influence interpretation of plotted values’ absolute magnitudes. It is well established that design choices (e.g., y-axis truncation) affect interpretation of plotted values’ *relative* magnitudes, yet *absolute* magnitudes have been under-explored. In several controlled experiments, using a range of visualisation types I demonstrate that 

The design conveys context.
