# Metaphors for War

“Ich bin ein Berliner”

We are often helped by metaphors in language. They allow us to tie a new concept to something we know. They promote comprehension by capturing meaning in a manner that can be quickly and accurately perceived. But metaphors are concerned with concepts: a ‘cold’ war where no weapons are fired (if ‘heat’ = hostility/conflict). A different type of abstract representation is art: translation to a sensory domain. The horrors of war are adeptly expressed in a cubist painting. These are impossible to quantify, but artists seek to capture them. The cubist painting is effective because it is faithful to the underlying concept. But some things are not so abstract, they may be difficult to measure or count, but we do it anyway. Like the number of soliders at different stages in a battle. We can also express these using metaphors: metaphors which are a testament to the nature of the information. This information is more precise than an abstract concept. Therefore, we have the opportunity for using a medium which appreciates precision, we exploit our senses. Display is systematic.

Data visualisations are abstract in the sense that they don’t show the actual thing, but not abstract in the sense that an artwork is. There is a clear relationship. The number represent a state of the world, and the visualisation represents those numbers. 

Iraq war deaths - coalition and civilian deaths
Unnecessary deaths during the Crimean War as a result of preventable infections

The medium is a critical feature of effective communication. People dislike meeting that should have been emails, but for certain situations an email is massively inappropriate. 

What about the presentation of numbers? Reading them takes a long time, writing them down makes your eyes hurt. Getting someone to recognise a pattern straight away requires both precision and speed. This is data visualisation. 

A testament to their ubiquity is the battery icon: a visualisation only a few pixels wide, that we carry everywhere we go. 

So they are a tool for representation, for helping us think. They facilitate cognition through efficient and clear external representations. 

Scaife and Rogers (1996) referred to graphics like data visualisations as ‘external representations’, and established the concept of ‘external cognition’, which concerns the influence of these graphics on cognitive processing. Key features of this concept include facilitating cognition through efficient and clear external representations (computational offloading; re-representation) and encouraging particular inferences through certain formats (graphical constraining). For further reference, who is citing Scaife and Rogers? See also Card (2002)

Data representations are a broad field, but they all share in common an ability to capture information and convey it in an efficient way. They exploit our sensory capabilities, and cognitive heuristics. 
Other examples include sonficiation and physicalisation, though visualisation is the most common. 

Yet, there are so many different ways to represent this information, so the question is, how do we design them for maximum effectiveness? There are many ways to define effectiveness, depending on the purpose of the visualisation (analysis, communication, persuasion). But they all require understanding of the interaction between the chart and the viewer. However, this space is also crowded by other concerns, usually aesthetic preferences. Where relevant, we can use scientific research. 

The issue - the very thing that makes visualisations effective (the metaphor) is what can make them misleading.

People like Huff write books about ‘how to mislead’, hoping that people will engage in the opposite, but what’s the opposite? An honest unbiased account, or a persuasive one? A designer who does not feel they are expressing a particular story is still advocating for a realisatic considered view of the data. That is, they are motivated to not mis-represent the data. 

Themes for introduction
  * benefits of data visualisation
  * purpose - truth telling - avoid misleading - Spiegelhalter/Harford
  * increase utility (maintain benefits, avoid harms) - through ensuring accuracy
  * it’s about effective communication for supporting cognition

I like the idea of study numbers because they have the illusion of objectivity and trustworthiness, which decreases likelihood of spotting bias and manipulation. They are also more precisely defined than other types of information, which means that we should theoretically all be able to represent them the same - yet this does not happen. We are not even always  consistent even with ourselves. But bias shouldn’t always be considered a negative thing - it reflects valuable features of our cognitive system. The popularity of the ‘chart-junk’ concept also speaks to an instinct that if only we presented data with minimal embellishments, we would show it in its purest form (Kosara, 2016). 

There is lots of choice in data visualisation; how can we make design choices that achieve our goal of effective communication (engagement, enlightenment, shock, understanding, knowledge, utility).

# The Thesis

  * What are your aims and objectives?
  * Can your research question be answered by your research strategy?
  * How are the ideas original - what are the gaps in current work?
  * What has your research done differently to advance our understanding?

Look at reviewer comments to see what are considered my successful contributions 

My role is not to cover all bases and predict precisely what will happen. Instead, I’m trying to highlight what we should be aware of, what might cause problems. 

# Thesis Statement?

It is my thesis that interpretations of magnitude can differ according to the design of a data visualisation. Judgements pertaining to values’ magnitudes are under-explored in data visualisation research, but are relevant to interpretations and decision-making. The effect is one of context: certain aspects of a chart subtly convey the context surrounding values, giving cues to magnitude. However, it must be recognised that there are limits to a chart’s influence, and that magnitudes judgements are not wholly determined by the presentation style.
