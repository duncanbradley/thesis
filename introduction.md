# Introduction

# Metaphors for War

“Ich bin ein Berliner”

We are often helped by metaphors in language. They allow us to tie a new concept to something we know. They promote comprehension by capturing meaning in a manner that can be quickly and accurately perceived. But metaphors are concerned with concepts: a ‘cold’ war where no weapons are fired (if ‘heat’ = hostility/conflict). A different type of abstract representation is art: translation to a sensory domain. The horrors of war are adeptly expressed in a cubist painting. These are impossible to quantify, but artists seek to capture them. The cubist painting is effective because it is faithful to the underlying concept. But some things are not so abstract, they may be difficult to measure or count, but we do it anyway. Like the number of soliders at different stages in a battle. We can also express these using metaphors: metaphors which are a testament to the nature of the information. This information is more precise than an abstract concept. Therefore, we have the opportunity for using a medium which appreciates precision, we exploit our senses. Display is systematic.

The medium is a critical feature of effective communication. People dislike meeting that should have been emails, but for certain situations an email is massively inappropriate. 

What about the presentation of numbers? Reading them takes a long time, writing them down makes your eyes hurt. Getting someone to recognise a pattern straight away requires both precision and speed. This is data visualisation. 

A testament to their ubiquity is the battery icon: a visualisation only a few pixels wide, that we carry everywhere we go. 

So they are a tool for representation, for helping us think. They facilitate cognition through efficient and clear external representations. 

Scaife and Rogers (1996) referred to graphics like data visualisations as ‘external representations’, and established the concept of ‘external cognition’, which concerns the influence of these graphics on cognitive processing. Key features of this concept include facilitating cognition through efficient and clear external representations (computational offloading; re-representation) and encouraging particular inferences through certain formats (graphical constraining). For further reference, who is citing Scaife and Rogers? See also Card (2002)

Data representations are a broad field, but they all share in common an ability to capture information and convey it in an efficient way. They exploit our sensory capabilities, and cognitive heuristics. 
Other examples include sonficiation and physicalisation, though visualisation is the most common. 

Yet, there are so many different ways to represent this information, so the question is, how do we design them for maximum effectiveness? There are many ways to define effectiveness, depending on the purpose of the visualisation (analysis, communication, persuasion). But they all require understanding of the interaction between the chart and the viewer. However, this space is also crowded by other concerns, usually aesthetic preferences. Where relevant, we can use scientific research. 

The issue - the very thing that makes visualisations effective (the metaphor) is what can make them misleading.

People like Huff write books about ‘how to mislead’, hoping that people will engage in the opposite, but what’s the opposite? An honest unbiased account, or a persuasive one? A designer who does not feel they are expressing a particular story is still advocating for a realisatic considered view of the data. That is, they are motivated to not mis-represent the data. 


# The Thesis

  * What are your aims and objectives?
  * Can your research question be answered by your research strategy?
  * How are the ideas original - what are the gaps in current work?
  * What has your research done differently to advance our understanding?

Look at reviewer comments to see what are considered my successful contributions 

My role is not to cover all bases and predict precisely what will happen. Instead, I’m trying to highlight what we should be aware of, what might cause problems. 

# The State of Visualisation and Psychology Research

The stuff that has been really successful isn't really new. It's established psychology effects applied to visualisation (attention for focus and declutter, curse of knowledge, datasaurus (Boger)). What does this say about where we need to look for new knoweldge?

Why do we need vis research?

How much difference does it make really?

Desbarats - is it all just ‘it depends’?

How good is the evidence we do have?

# Precision

Heer and Bostock
Correll et al (2012) - Comparing Averages in Time Series Data
Why shouldn't everything be a scatterplot?
Zacks and Tversky - different chart types serve different purposes

Showing less precise data can make things easier to see (aggregation in timeseries) - the opposite of anscombe’s quartet

# General Framing in Data Vis - Cognitive Bias

Zacks and Tversky - if different chart types serve different purposes, are we at risk of being mislead by the chart type
What other ways could we be mislead, not by imprecision (perceptual bias), but by cognitive bias.

Does inclusion of a visualisation actually increase persuasion/trust/belief (Tal & Wansink) + failed replication

Misleading - Rogowitz et al. 1996

# Visualisation Literacy

What would a bias-sensitive measure of data visualisation literacy look like, given what now know about bias?

Look at: CALVI: Critical Thinking Assessment for Literacy in Visualizations

# Truncation

To what extent is there a difference in the definitions of 'axis truncation':
  * both ends vs. one end
  * bars vs. axes
What is it about Witt’s study that means it can give such precise recommendations whereas others can’t

# Numerical Framing

General knowledge on cognition about numbers - couple of papers summarising how good/bad we are and interesting findings. 
Non-visual perspective
What is framing generally? What does it show about how our brains represent information?
Lundquist et al. 
Link to Grice - readers/viewers make assumptions about communicative intent. They aren’t just passive receipients. 
Therefore there is a trust element - when trust is high, more likely to fail to question the delivery of the message. 

Other numerical biases have been studied in a datavis context e.g. Dimara et al. 2017, 2019
