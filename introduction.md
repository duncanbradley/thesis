# Introduction

# Metaphors for War

“Ich bin ein Berliner”

We are often helped by metaphors in language. They allow us to tie a new concept to something we know. They promote comprehension by capturing meaning in a manner that can be quickly and accurately perceived. But metaphors are concerned with concepts: a ‘cold’ war where no weapons are fired (if ‘heat’ = hostility/conflict). A different type of abstract representation is art: translation to a sensory domain. The horrors of war are adeptly expressed in a cubist painting. These are impossible to quantify, but artists seek to capture them. The cubist painting is effective because it is faithful to the underlying concept. But some things are not so abstract, they may be difficult to measure or count, but we do it anyway. Like the number of soliders at different stages in a battle. We can also express these using metaphors: metaphors which are a testament to the nature of the information. This information is more precise than an abstract concept. Therefore, we have the opportunity for using a medium which appreciates precision, we exploit our senses. Display is systematic.

The medium is a critical feature of effective communication. People dislike meeting that should have been emails, but for certain situations an email is massively inappropriate. 

What about the presentation of numbers? Reading them takes a long time, writing them down makes your eyes hurt. Getting someone to recognise a pattern straight away requires both precision and speed. This is data visualisation. 

A testament to their ubiquity is the battery icon: a visualisation only a few pixels wide, that we carry everywhere we go. 






# The Thesis

  * What are your aims and objectives?
  * Can your research question be answered by your research strategy?
  * How are the ideas original - what are the gaps in current work?
  * What has your research done differently to advance our understanding?

Look at reviewer comments to see what are considered my successful contributions 

My role is not to cover all bases and predict precisely what will happen. Instead, I’m trying to highlight what we should be aware of, what might cause problems. 

# The State of Visualisation and Psychology Research

The stuff that has been really successful isn't really new. It's established psychology effects applied to visualisation (attention for focus and declutter, curse of knowledge). What does this say about where we need to look for new knoweldge?

Correll: Are We Making Progress In Visualization Research?
and Kosara (2016) - Empire Built on Sand

Why do we need vis research?

  * Kopp et al. - embellishments
  
How much difference does it make really?

Desbarats - is it all just ‘it depends’?

# Precision

# General Framing in Data Vis - Cogtnitive Bias

Zacks and Tversky - if different chart types serve different purposes, are we at risk of being mislead by the chart type
What other ways could we be mislead, not by imprecision (perceptual bias), but by cognitive bias.

# Visualisation Literacy

What would a bias-sensitive measure of data visualisation literacy look like, given what now know about bias?

Look at: CALVI: Critical Thinking Assessment for Literacy in Visualizations

# Truncation

To what extent is there a difference in the definitions of 'axis truncation':
  * both ends vs. one end
  * bars vs. axes
What is it about Witt’s study that means it can give such precise recommendations whereas others can’t

# Numerical Framing

Non-visual perspective
What is framing generally? What does it show about how our brains represent information?
Lundquist et al. 
Link to Grice - readers/viewers make assumptions about communicative intent. They aren’t just passive receipients. 
Therefore there is a trust element - when trust is high, more likely to fail to question the delivery of the message.
