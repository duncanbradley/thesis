When communicating with words, using metaphors helps conveys ideas. When communicating with numbers, data visualisations perform a similar role. A list of numbers can allude to an upwards trend, but representing those numbers *as* visual phenomena facilitates comprehension.

Whilst metaphors are evocative, data visualisations afford precision. In a line chart plotting an upward trend, the pattern depicted corresponds to the exact nature of the increase. The human visual system’s sensitivity to this type of systematic depiction makes data visualisation a powerful tool. Presenting a different pattern would elicit a different mental representation. 

Broadly, data visualisations make it easier for the brain to process numerical information. As *external* representations, they reduce perceptual and cognitive burdens in interpretation (Scaife and Rogers, 1996). Imparting efficiency and clarity facilitates pattern-recognition and reasoning. 

However, a single dataset can be depicted in countless different ways, and results can vary widely (Franconeri et al., 2021). Thus, data visualisation’s strength can also be its vulnerability. Outsourcing cognitive processes to a graphical depiction leaves a viewer at the mercy of the chosen method of visual representation. Thus, effective design is crucial. 

There are many ways to define effectiveness, depending on the purpose of the visualisation (analysis, communication, persuasion). 
But are we looking for accuracy? or speed? or something broader? 
Effectiveness could also be considered engagement?
Need to define it more narrowly as a concern with faithful representation of data. 
However, given limitations in data, we might think about this on a broaded scale. Instead, we might more accurately think of this in terms of how faithfully the visualisation represents the state of the world that the data pertain to. 

Grice (1975) characterises discourse as essentially cooperative in nature. Among others, ‘quality’ (i.e. truthfulness) is a central aspect of effective communication. 

The goal of data visualisation is to promote recognition, examination and retention of this trend.
This means they are not only used for communication, but for analytical tasks. 

Data representations are a broad field, but they all share in common an ability to capture information and convey it in an efficient way. They exploit our sensory capabilities, and cognitive heuristics. 
Other examples include sonficiation and physicalisation, though visualisation is the most common. 

Yet, there are so many different ways to represent this information, so the question is, how do we design them for maximum effectiveness? There are many ways to define effectiveness, depending on the purpose of the visualisation (analysis, communication, persuasion). But they all require understanding of the interaction between the chart and the viewer. However, this space is also crowded by other concerns, usually aesthetic preferences. Where relevant, we can use scientific research. 

The issue - the very thing that makes visualisations effective (the metaphor) is what can make them misleading. 
People like Huff write books about ‘how to mislead’, hoping that people will engage in the opposite, but what’s the opposite? An honest unbiased account, or a persuasive one? A designer who does not feel they are expressing a particular story is still advocating for a realisatic considered view of the data. That is, they are motivated to not mis-represent the data. 

When taken at face value, a poorly design chart can be miselading

Themes for introduction
  * benefits of data visualisation
  * purpose - truth telling - avoid misleading - Spiegelhalter/Harford
  * increase utility (maintain benefits, avoid harms) - through ensuring accuracy
  * it’s about effective communication for supporting cognition

Effective communication of numerical information is typically concerned with clarity and coherence. 

I like the idea of study numbers because they have the illusion of objectivity and trustworthiness, which decreases likelihood of spotting bias and manipulation. They are also more precisely defined than other types of information, which means that we should theoretically all be able to represent them the same - yet this does not happen. We are not even always  consistent even with ourselves. But bias shouldn’t always be considered a negative thing - it reflects valuable features of our cognitive system. The popularity of the ‘chart-junk’ concept also speaks to an instinct that if only we presented data with minimal embellishments, we would show it in its purest form (Kosara, 2016). 

There is lots of choice in data visualisation; how can we make design choices that achieve our goal of effective communication (engagement, enlightenment, shock, understanding, knowledge, utility). 

Consider a pie chart showing the composition of a country’s energy sources. If exactly half of a country’s energy is generated by fossil fuels, this source will be represented by exactly half of the pie chart. When the pie chart’s fossil fuel segment occupies more or less than 50% of the chart, this is easily detected/reflected in mental representation.

# The Thesis

  * What are your aims and objectives?
  * Can your research question be answered by your research strategy?
  * How are the ideas original - what are the gaps in current work?
  * What has your research done differently to advance our understanding?

Look at reviewer comments to see what are considered my successful contributions 

My role is not to cover all bases and predict precisely what will happen. Instead, I’m trying to highlight what we should be aware of, what might cause problems. 

# Thesis Statement?

It is my thesis that interpretations of magnitude can differ according to the design of a data visualisation. Judgements pertaining to values’ magnitudes are under-explored in data visualisation research, but are relevant to interpretations and decision-making. The effect is one of context: certain aspects of a chart subtly convey the context surrounding values, giving cues to magnitude. However, it must be recognised that there are limits to a chart’s influence, and that magnitudes judgements are not wholly determined by the presentation style.
