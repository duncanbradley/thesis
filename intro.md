# Introduction

Data visualisations help people make sense of numbers. Whilst a list of numbers may allude to an upwards trend, presenting those numbers *as* visual phenomena can aid interpretation. A data visualisation systematically depicts the precise numerical values, facilitating mental processing of this information. 

As *external* representations of data, visualisations reduce perceptual and cognitive burdens in interpretation (Scaife and Rogers, 1996). By imparting efficiency and clarity, data visualisations support pattern-recognition and reasoning. However, a single dataset can be depicted in numerous ways, and different designs can vary widely in their effectiveness (Franconeri et al., 2021). Thus, data visualisation’s strength can also be its vulnerability. Outsourcing cognitive processes to a graphical depiction leaves a viewer at the mercy of the chosen method of visual representation. Thus, understanding successful design is crucial.

The effectiveness of data visualisations can be defined in many ways, encompassing their various objectives, which include informing, persuading, engaging and promoting retention (Bertini et al., 2020). However, in general, successful data visualisations will convey pertinent information in a visually- and cognitively-comprehensible manner (Macklinay, 1986; van Wijk, 2005). Failing to meet these criteria risks misleading viewers, which is antithetical to the purpose of data visualisation. Therefore, knowledge of human factors in visualisation is vital for ensuring charts, graphs, and maps achieve their potential.

## Research Motivation and Objective

Interpreting data in any medium does not involve simply observing numerical values, but rather identifying patterns and making *inferences* about the data. For example, one may notice that values are decreasing rapidly, or that there is substantial variability in the dataset, or that some data is missing. One may also make inferences about how large or small values are. This is an important aspect of understanding data, because the same numerical value can be considered large or small depending on its context.

The BBC radio programme *More or Less*, which examines statistics reported in the news and elsewhere, often addresses this issue. Some figures may instinctively seem large, others small. However, asking the question ‘Is it a big number?’ considers whether this initial impression is appropriate. For example, a country’s multi-trillion dollar national debt may seem large, but may be similar to that of other countries when accounting for its high gross domenstic product. Similarly, understanding the context of the Richter scale is required to determine that a value less than one does indeed reflect a small earthquake magnitude. Gauging magnitude is important for understanding numbers in a wide variety of situations.

As data visualisations are used to convey numerical information, it is important to understand how viewers interpret the magnitude of presented values. Studying the cognitive processing of magnitude reveal how inferences are generated and provide insight into the effects of design choices. This, in turn, can inform recommendations for designers who may wish to represent the magnitude of values using graphical cues. Yet, this has been an underexplored topic in visualisation, with insufficient empirical research exploring this aspect of interpreting visualisations. The aim of this thesis is to generate robust empirical evidence on the interpretation of magnitude in data visualisations, using controlled experiments.

## Overview of the Thesis 

Research questions
In this chapter, I review related research to provide context for the empirical work conducted in this project, before outlining the structure of the thesis itself.

## Contributions

Through a series of empirical experiments, I demonstrate that data visualisation design choices can affect mental representation of numbers’ magnitudes. These large-sample, controlled experiments strengthen and expand the evidence base on this overlooked aspect of data visualisation. This work reveals that, in various types of visualisations, graphical cues to context play a role in the processing of how large or small values are. Specifically, judgements about magnitude are informed by the relative positions of values within axis limits. Focusing on underlying cognitive mechanisms contributes findings which are applicable to a variety of visualisation formats. These findings also contribute recommendations for designers, which involve considering suitable axis ranges in order to convey magnitude appropriately. This guidance challenges a convention in data visualisation design and advocates against the use of particular default settings, where appropriate.
