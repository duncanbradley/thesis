Instead, I’m trying to highlight what we should be aware of, what might cause problems.\n\n2 The State of Visualisation and Psychology Research\nThe stuff that has been really successful isn’t really new. It’s established psychology effects applied to visualisation (attention for focus and declutter, curse of knowledge). What does this say about where we need to look for new knoweldge?\nLook at: Position Paper: Are We Making Progress In Visualization Research? and Kosara (2016) - Empire Built on Sand\nWhy do we need vis research?\nRobert Kosara pie chart misconception work Elting Burns et al. (2021) - misconception about difficulty Chart Junk * Beyond memorability - Borkin * Kopp et al. - embellishments\nHow much difference does it make really?
